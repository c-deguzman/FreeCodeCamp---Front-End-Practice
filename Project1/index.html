          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Euclid was a great Greek mathematician. Although little is known about his early and personal life, he went on to contribute greatly in the field of mathematics and came to known as the ‘Father of Geometry’, Euclid is known to have taught mathematics in Ancient Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy I. He wrote ‘Elements’, the most influential mathematical works of all time, which served as the main textbook for teaching mathematics from its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century. Elements aroused interest of the Western World and mathematicians around the globe for over 2000 years. Euclid used the ‘synthetic approach’ towards producing his theorems, definitions and axioms. Apart from being a tutor at the Alexandria library, Euclid coined and structured the different elements of mathematics, such as Porisms, geometric systems, infinite values, factorizations, and the congruence of shapes that went on to contour Euclidian Geometry. His works were heavily influenced by Pythagoras, Aristotle, Eudoxus, and Thales to name a few.
